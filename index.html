        <p>The dog (Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated subspecies of the wolf, a mammal of the Canidae family of the
            order
            Carnivora. The term encompasses both feral and pet varieties and is also sometimes used to describe wild canids of
            other
            subspecies or species. The domestic dog has been (and continues to be) one of the most widely-kept working and
            companion
            animals in human history, as well as being a food source in some cultures. There are estimated to be 400 million
            dogs in
            the world.[1]</p>
